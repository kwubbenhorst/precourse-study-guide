<h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>HTML is one of three common languages used in web development along with CSS and JS.</li>
     <li>HTML provides the structure of websites like the frame of a house.</li><li>The head element contains mostly metadata which apart from the title is for the browser not the user.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li><li>Elements with other elements nested inside are called parent elements whereas the nested elements are called child elements</li><li>Semantic elements which are elements whose name describes its role and content are preferred in the body over code that relates to format.</li><li>Tags are short words or abbreviations between the pointy brackets that open and close an element whereas the element is everything nested between in that block of code.</li><li>p is a commonly used tag to make a paragraph ul is for unnumbered list and li for list item</li><li>For screen readers it is important to use the headings h1 to h6 in descending order of size and to include along with an image source an alt text string describing the image. The alt description can also boost search engine hits</li>

<h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, a way to change individual elements in the HTML code, internal CSS style sheet, a way to include style rules in an HTML head, and external CSS style sheet (most common), which keeps all style rules in a separate CSS file linked within the HTML head.</li><li>Separation of concerns is the concept that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li><li>CSS rules are structured with a selector outside wavy brackets and a declaration block within wavy brackets and subdivided into properties and values separated by colons and separated by semi colons from the next property and value set.  The selector defines what elements of the page the rules in the declaration block will apply.</li><li>Selectors can be two terms separated by a comma eg header and footer if you want the declaration block to apply to both. This helps to create don’t repeat yourself DRY code which is more compact and easier to maintain.</li><li>CSS box model means that each HTML element nests the content within layers of padding, border and margin.  Margin refers to the space outside the element, padding to what is within the element.  If you add a value to the padding you make the element bigger.</li><li>When CSS uses the wildcard or * as selector it means that all elements on the page will have the rule applied.</li><li>Besides text you can also apply CSS rules to images. The img selector will format all images in the markup.  Display property and block value means every img starts on a new line. Imgs can also be formatted for height width and margin-left and margin-right.</li><li>Unnumbered lists ul can also be a selector for CSS rules formatted for padding-left and font-size
Paragraphs p can also be a selector for CSS rules, formatted for text-align and font-size.</li><li>The CSS style sheet needs to be linked to the HTML code within the head in the index file after the last meta element and before the title element using link rel=“stylesheet” href=./assets/style.css” in pointy brackets.</li><li>Class selectors can be used in CSS to apply rules selectively to elements on a page.  The period before the selector term designates it as a class selector.  Eg .card makes a text box that can be valued in terms of various properties like width, margin, border, and box-shadow.</li><li>Colour values can be specified in English or using hexadecimal codes.  Refer to the HTML color codes website for the code key.</li>
